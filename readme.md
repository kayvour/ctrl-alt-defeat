# Ctrl-Alt-Defeat 🚀

> **A fullstack web application built entirely through AI prompting for the Prompt Wars hackathon**

This project was built as part of **Prompt Wars**, a hackathon where creativity meets code through the power of AI prompting. The goal: craft a complete fullstack website using only prompts — no manual coding allowed.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Ctrl-Alt-Defeat showcases the power of AI-driven development by demonstrating how complex web applications can be built entirely through strategic prompting and AI assistance. Every line of code, every design decision, and every feature was generated through careful prompt engineering.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔮 **Prompt-driven Development**: Built entirely using AI prompts
- ⚙️ **Fullstack Architecture**: Complete frontend and backend implementation
- 🚀 **Hackathon-ready**: Developed within hackathon time constraints
- 🧠 **100% AI-generated**: No manual coding involved
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, responsive design
- 🔧 **Production-ready**: Deployable web application

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js
- Modern CSS/Styling framework
- Responsive design

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- RESTful API architecture

**Database:**
- [Database technology used]

**Development:**
- AI-powered code generation
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Iterative development through AI conversation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kayvour/ctrl-alt-defeat.git
   cd ctrl-alt-defeat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # If backend is separate, navigate to backend directory
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in the root directory
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Add your environment variables
   # DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   # API_KEY=your_api_key
   # PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Start the development server
   npm start
   
   # Or if using separate frontend/backend
   # Terminal 1 (Backend)
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 (Frontend)
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## 📝 Usage

[Add specific usage instructions based on what the application does]

```bash
# Example commands
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run test     # Run tests
npm run lint     # Check code quality
```

## 🎨 Prompt Engineering Approach

This project demonstrates several key prompt engineering techniques:

- **Iterative Refinement**: Building features through conversational AI interaction
- **Context Management**: Maintaining project context across multiple prompts
- **Architectural Planning**: Using AI to design system architecture
- **Code Generation**: Generating complete, functional code components
- **Debugging**: Using AI to identify and fix issues

## 🏆 Hackathon Experience

**Event**: Prompt Wars Hackathon
**Theme**: AI-powered fullstack development
**Challenge**: Build a complete web application using only AI prompts
**Duration**: [Hackathon duration]
**Team**: Ctrl-Alt-Defeat

### What We Learned

- The power of well-crafted prompts in software development
- How AI can handle complex architectural decisions
