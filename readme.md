# Ctrl-Alt-Defeat 🚀

> **A fullstack web application built entirely through AI prompting for the Prompt Wars hackathon**

This project was built as part of **Prompt Wars**, a hackathon where creativity meets code through the power of AI prompting. The goal: craft a complete fullstack website using only prompts — no manual coding allowed.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Ctrl-Alt-Defeat showcases the power of AI-driven development by demonstrating how complex web applications can be built entirely through strategic prompting and AI assistance. Every line of code, every design decision, and every feature was generated through careful prompt engineering.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔮 **Prompt-driven Development**: Built entirely using AI prompts
- ⚙️ **Fullstack Architecture**: Complete frontend and backend implementation
- 🚀 **Hackathon-ready**: Developed within hackathon time constraints
- 🧠 **100% AI-generated**: No manual coding involved
- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, responsive design
- 🔧 **Production-ready**: Deployable web application

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React.js
- Modern CSS/Styling framework
- Responsive design

**Backend:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- RESTful API architecture

**Development:**
- AI-powered code generation
- Prompt engineering techniques
- Iterative development through AI conversation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kayvour/ctrl-alt-defeat.git
   cd ctrl-alt-defeat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install
   
   # If backend is separate, navigate to backend directory
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in the root directory
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Add your environment variables
   # DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   # API_KEY=your_api_key
   # PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Start the development server
   npm start
   
   # Or if using separate frontend/backend
   # Terminal 1 (Backend)
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 (Frontend)
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## 📝 Usage

# 🧠🔥 **Prompt Roast: The AI Therapist You Never Asked For**

## 🚀 Overview
**Prompt Roast** is a brutally honest, emotionally chaotic web app that combines the sarcasm of a roast session with the surprising depth of an AI therapy couch.

Instead of just improving your prompts, this app **calls you out**, **breaks you down**, and occasionally… **heals you**.

## 💡 Core Utility

### 🧨 1. **AI-Powered Prompt Roast**
- Users submit their **worst, vaguest, or most unhinged prompts**
- The app **generates savage, creative, and often absurd insults** targeting the quality (or lack thereof) in the input
- Roast modes include:
  - *Mild Sass ("Bless your heart... that prompt was brave.")*
  - *Savage Mode ("This prompt made the AI contemplate its own existence.")*
  - *Shakespearean Shade ("Thy query be as void as a black hole's soul.")*

### 🛋️ 2. **Prompt Psychoanalysis**
- If the roast doesn’t destroy you, the AI will try to **understand you**
- It asks *why* you wrote that prompt, *what you’re running from*, and *how your inner child feels about it*
- Features include:
  - 🧠 **Deep Prompt Therapy**  
    ("Let’s unpack this—do you feel heard when you prompt?")
  - 📖 **Journaling Mode**  
    ("Tell me what the prompt *really* means to you.")
  - 👶 **Inner Child Response**  
    ("Sounds like 9-year-old you just wanted a friend.")

## 🎯 Why It Exists

> Prompt Roast isn’t just an app — it’s an experience.  
> An emotional rollercoaster where you come to write prompts... and leave with existential clarity.

- Challenges traditional prompt engineering by leaning into **human flaws**
- Uses **humor and depth** to teach good prompting by showcasing bad prompting
- Turns prompt writing into something **visceral, weirdly intimate**, and **wildly entertaining**

## 🔥 Use Cases

- **Hackathon stress relief** 😤
- **Prompt-engineering gone rogue** 💻
- **AI-enabled emotional masochism** 🥲
- **Midnight existential breakdowns** 🌙

## 👾 Future Add-Ons

- Prompt leaderboards: "Top 10 Most Roasted"
- AI Mood Selector: Therapist / Stand-up Comic / Disappointed Mom
- Prompt Redemption Button: "OK fine, here’s a better version."

## 🎨 Prompt Engineering Approach

This project demonstrates several key prompt engineering techniques:

- **Iterative Refinement**: Building features through conversational AI interaction
- **Context Management**: Maintaining project context across multiple prompts
- **Architectural Planning**: Using AI to design system architecture
- **Code Generation**: Generating complete, functional code components
- **Debugging**: Using AI to identify and fix issues

## 🏆 Hackathon Experience
