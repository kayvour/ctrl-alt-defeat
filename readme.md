# 🤖🔥🛋️ **Prompt Roast: Where Your Prompt Gets Roasted and Your Soul Gets Read**

## 🌀 What Is It?

**Prompt Roast** is an emotionally unstable AI web app that takes your poorly written, overly ambitious, or downright cursed prompt...

…and **roasts the life out of it** 💣 *while also psychoanalyzing you* 🧠.

Because let’s face it:  
> **If your prompt is bad, maybe so is everything you’ve repressed.**

## 🧠🔥 Dual Functionality

### 🧨 1. **Savage Roast Engine**
The app unleashes unfiltered, AI-generated mockery with creative insults like:
- *“This prompt made ChatGPT throw a 500 error in self-defense.”*
- *“You clearly typed this while running late and emotionally unavailable.”*
- *“Your prompt is the literary equivalent of soggy cereal.”*

🔧 **Custom Roast Modes**:
- Light Roast ☕: "Oops! A little vague, champ."
- Charred 🔥: "Your prompt just made a Python script cry."
- Shakespearean Tragedy 🎭: "Thy query is more confused than Hamlet at a coding bootcamp."

### 🛋️ 2. **AI Therapy Session**
At the same time, the app takes a disturbingly deep look at *why* you wrote what you wrote.

👂 **Features**:
- *Emotional Dissection*: “This sounds less like a question… and more like a cry for help.”
- *Childhood Trauma Scan*: “Were you ignored as a child when you asked questions? Let’s talk.”
- *Prompt-to-Purpose Reflection*: “Are you really asking for blog ideas… or for meaning?”
